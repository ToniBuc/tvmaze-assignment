# TV Maze Assignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.2.

## Getting started

There are two custom scripts made available to get the app up and running, pick one to run depending on your situation/preference:

Run `npm run assignment` to install dependencies, build the app and serve it.

Run `npm run assignment:ng` to globally install Angular CLI version 18.0.2, then install dependencies, build the app and serve it.

## Use

When using the app you will be greeted by the show list with some preloaded shows.

The search bar will allow you to filter the show list based on the name of the shows. The app retains the search state, so when navigating between pages, your search term will remain for your convenience.

The show list itself is made up of cards that display show images. When hovering over the cards, the name and premiere date of the specific show will be displayed.

Upon clicking on a card, you will be taken to the details page of your chosen show.
